## Technical Implementation 🔧

### Firebase Storage Integration

#### Upload Process:
```typescript
1. User selects image from gallery or camera
2. Image is fetched as a blob
3. Unique filename is generated: profile_{userId}_{timestamp}.jpg
4. Image is uploaded to Firebase Storage: profile-images/{filename}
5. Download URL is retrieved and saved to Firestore
6. Old profile image is deleted (if exists)
```

#### Storage Structure:
```
Firebase Storage:
└── profile-images/
    ├── profile_user123_1697500000000.jpg
    ├── profile_user456_1697500123000.jpg
    └── ...
```

#### Firestore Document:
```typescript
users/{userId}
{
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  province: "Punjab",
  district: "Lahore",
  profileImageUrl: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/...",
  createdAt: "2025-10-16T...",
  updatedAt: "2025-10-16T..."
}
```

### Image Upload Function

```typescript
const uploadImageToStorage = async (uri: string): Promise<string> => {
  // 1. Fetch image as blob
  const response = await fetch(uri);
  const blob = await response.blob();
  
  // 2. Create unique filename
  const filename = `profile_${auth.currentUser.uid}_${Date.now()}.jpg`;
  const storageRef = ref(storage, `profile-images/${filename}`);
  
  // 3. Upload blob to Firebase Storage
  await uploadBytes(storageRef, blob);
  
  // 4. Get permanent download URL
  const downloadURL = await getDownloadURL(storageRef);
  return downloadURL;
};
```

### Automatic Cleanup

Old profile images are automatically deleted when users upload new ones:

```typescript
const deleteOldProfileImage = async (imageUrl: string) => {
  if (imageUrl && imageUrl.includes('firebasestorage.googleapis.com')) {
    const imagePath = extractPathFromURL(imageUrl);
    const imageRef = ref(storage, imagePath);
    await deleteObject(imageRef);
  }
};
```

## User Flow 📱

1. User taps "Account Settings" from account screen
2. Settings screen loads with current user data

   - District
4. "Save Changes" button appears when changes are detected
5. User taps "Save Changes"
6. Data is validated and saved to Firestore
7. Success message is shown
8. Updated data reflects in account screen

## UI Components 🎨

## Validation Rules ✅

### Name:
- ✅ Cannot be empty
- ✅ Whitespace is trimmed
- ❌ No minimum/maximum length (flexible)

### Email:
- 🔒 Read-only (cannot be changed)
- Linked to Firebase Authentication

### Location:
- ✅ Province must be selected
- ✅ District must be selected
- ❌ Cannot save with incomplete location

### Profile Picture:
- ✅ Optional field
- ✅ JPG format (auto-converted)
- ✅ Square aspect ratio (1:1)
- ✅ Quality: 70% (balanced size/quality)
- ❌ No size limit enforced (Firebase Storage handles this)

## Error Handling 🛡️

### Image Upload Errors:
```typescript
- Permission denied → Alert user to grant permissions
- Upload failed → Show "Upload Failed" alert
- Network error → Retry mechanism (user retries manually)
- Invalid image → Alert user and don't save
```

### Save Errors:
```typescript
- No internet → Firestore handles offline persistence
- Validation failed → Show specific error message
- Update failed → Show generic error and keep form data
```

### Unsaved Changes:
```typescript
- Back button pressed → Show "Discard Changes?" alert
- Two options: "Stay" or "Discard"
- Prevents accidental data loss
```

## Firebase Storage Rules

Recommended Firebase Storage rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Profile images
    match /profile-images/{imageId} {
      // Only authenticated users can read
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      
      // Only the user can upload their own profile image
      allow write: if request.auth != null 
                   && imageId.matches('profile_' + request.auth.uid + '_.*');
      
      // Only allow images
      allow write: if request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');
      
      // Limit file size to 5MB
      allow write: if request.resource.size < 5 * 1024 * 1024;
    }
  }
}
```

## Firestore Security Rules

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      // Users can read their own data
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      // Users can update their own data
      allow update: if request.auth != null 
                    && request.auth.uid == userId
                    && request.resource.data.keys().hasOnly([
                      'name', 'province', 'district', 
                      'profileImageUrl', 'updatedAt'
                    ]);
      
      // Email cannot be changed
      allow update: if request.resource.data.email == resource.data.email;
    }
  }
}
```
